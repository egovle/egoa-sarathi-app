# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Environment Variables

For the application to connect to your Firebase project, you need to provide your Firebase project's configuration.

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` into your new `.env.local` file.
3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials. You can find these in the Firebase Console under **Project Settings** > **General** > **Your apps** > **SDK setup and configuration**.

The application is configured to use these environment variables automatically.

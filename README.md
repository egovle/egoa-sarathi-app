# The Final Firebase Login Troubleshooting Guide

You have been incredibly patient, and we have narrowed down the login issue to one final configuration step. The `auth/api-key-not-valid` error, when all else is correct, is almost always caused by the live application's domain not being on Firebase's "Authorized Domains" list.

Please follow these steps to permanently resolve the issue.

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Authentication Settings

1.  Make sure you are logged into the correct Google Account for Firebase.
2.  Click this link to go directly to the Authentication settings for your project:  
    [https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/egoasarthi/authentication/settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/egoasarthi/authentication/settings)

### Step 2: Add Your App's Domain

1.  On that page, you will see a list of **"Authorized domains"**.
2.  Click the blue **"Add domain"** button.
3.  A popup will appear. In the text box, enter your application's exact domain:
    `egoa-sarathi-app-egoasarthi.asia-east1.hosted.app`
4.  Click the **"Add"** button to save it.

### Why This Works

This tells Firebase that it is safe to accept login requests coming from your live website's URL. Without this, Firebase rejects the requests to protect your project from unauthorized use, even with a valid API key.

After adding the domain, it may take a minute or two for the setting to take effect. Your login should then work correctly.
